I am a quantum computing researcher and software developer working at the intersection of **quantum compilation**, **systems engineering**, and **backend development**.  
I publish research on quantum-classical software stacks, contribute to quantum compiler infrastructure, and build tools that bridge theory and practice.

**Graduated (2023)** with published work in Springer and invited presentations at international quantum computing seminars.

## Ongoing Research

My research centers on **quantum compilation and distributed quantum systems**.  
I explore how **Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR)** can serve as a generalized bridge between quantum programming frameworks and diverse hardware backends.

Key themes include:
- Adaptive quantum compilation using device-specific performance profiles  
- Hardware-aware circuit partitioning and task allocation in **distributed quantum networks**  
- Integration of QIR into classical-quantum hybrid runtimes for scalable execution  
- Systems-level optimization of quantum-classical interfaces for speed and reliability

This ongoing work builds on ideas from my experimental projects such as `C_qir`, `qc_simulator`, and the distributed FastAPI-based **QTask** system.

**Current research position:** Quantum Software Research Intern at QWorld (July 2025 - Present), working on optimal task-to-QPU mapping algorithms for distributed quantum systems. Manuscript in preparation for QCAMP.

## Open Source Contributions

I actively contribute to [qBraid/qbraid-qir](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir), focusing on QIR profile compliance and quantum circuit preprocessing.

- [#225](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/pull/225) â€” Implemented Adaptive Execution Profile support with measurement state tracking, register-based output recording, and validation of post-measurement qubit operations. Added profile-based architecture enabling JSON-defined QIR profiles for different quantum execution models (Closed [#199](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/issues/199))

- [#228](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/pull/228) â€” Implemented QIR Base Profile compliance by adding measurement state tracking to prevent quantum operations on measured qubits, enforcing qubit reset requirements, and ensuring proper function usage per Base Profile specification (Closed [#224](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/issues/224))

- [#248](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/pull/248) â€” Refactored Cirq circuit preprocessing to use `optimize_for_target_gateset` with custom `QirTargetGateSet` class, fixing unnecessary gate decomposition and preserving supported gates (H, CNOT, TOFFOLI) while properly handling classically-controlled operations (Closed [#93](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/issues/93))

## Projects

### Quantum Computing Research

- **[C_qir](https://github.com/feelerx/C_qir)** â€“ A compiler pipeline converting universal quantum instructions written in C to Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR), enabling C code execution on any QIR-compatible quantum backend. This work directly led to an invited presentation at the National Polytechnic Institute Baja California (October 2025).

- **[qc_simulator](https://github.com/feelerx/qc_simulator)** â€“ A quantum circuit simulator implementing three distinct computational approaches (matrix multiplication, tensor product, direct qubit manipulation) in both C and Python. Comparative performance analysis published in *Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing: Early Innovations* (Springer, 2025).

### Systems Programming & Optimization

- **[AutoFreer](https://github.com/feelerx/autofreer)** â€“ An automatic memory management system implemented as a lightweight DLL for C, achieving 10-20% faster execution and lower memory overhead compared to the Boehm-Demers-Weiser library. Built on insights from reverse-engineering MSVC's malloc/calloc/realloc/free implementations (undergraduate thesis work).
