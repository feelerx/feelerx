I am a software developer and researcher working at the intersection of **systems engineering**, **quantum software**, and **backend engineering**.  
I build backend systems, contribute to quantum compiler infrastructure, and develop open-source tools that bridge theory and practice.

## About Me

- **Focus areas:** Quantum software, compiler infrastructure, and distributed system design  
- **Backend expertise:** Django, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker  
- **Quantum stack:** Qiskit, QIR, simulators, and hardware-aware compilation  
- **Other interests:** Systems programming (C/C++) and tooling

---

## Ongoing Research

My research centers on **quantum compilation and distributed systems**.  
I explore how **Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR)** can serve as a generalized bridge between quantum programming frameworks and diverse hardware backends.

Key themes include:
- Adaptive quantum compilation using device-specific performance profiles  
- Hardware-aware circuit partitioning and task allocation in **distributed quantum networks**  
- Integration of QIR into classical-quantum hybrid runtimes for scalable execution  
- Systems-level optimization of quantum-classical interfaces for speed and reliability

This ongoing work builds on ideas from my experimental projects such as `C_qir`, `qc_simulator`, and the distributed FastAPI-based **QTask** system.

## Open Source Contributions

I actively contribute to [qBraid/qbraid-qir](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir), focusing on QIR-based compilation workflows and adaptive quantum profiles.

- [#225](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/pull/225) â€” Closed [#199](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/issues/199)  
- [#228](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/pull/228) â€” Closed [#224](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/issues/224)  
- [#248](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/pull/248) â€” Closed [#93](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/issues/93)  

These contributions strengthened core features related to QIR execution, validation, and interoperability with quantum frameworks.
